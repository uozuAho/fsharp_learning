# Vending machine kata

The goals for this implementation:
- hide implementation details from the user (user = tests)

I followed the 'Enterprise TTT' approach.

# todo
- coin return: test multiple coins
- coin return: test when no coins entered
- coin return: test multiple returns after 1 coin entered
- does impl need an API? can it just expose functions that
  users need to use?
